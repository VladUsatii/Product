    <h1 style="position: relative;text-align:left;font-family: 'Kievit Serif', sans-serif;font-size: 38px;color:white;padding-bottom: 25px;">What information do we collect to target you with ads?</h1>
        <h2 class="blogs">To keep things plain and simple, here are the things that Product and partners collect from its users per the Terms of Service and Data Policy Agreement. We've written it in plain English and non-Swahili so that users understand what they've signed up for. Another important note is that this Ad Tracking statement does not change and won't change for any reason. Accounts will be heavily notified if there is a sudden tweak to the Ad Tracking statement. The statement is as follows:</h2>
        <h3 class="blogs" style="font-size:22px;font-weight:600;">Data Categories</h3>
        <h2 class="blogs">Upon signing up, Product collects your email and password. Keep in mind that your password is hashed and unviewable by Product and staff. This is a security implementation to avoid theft and legal incidents.<br /><br />After signing up and giving us these few fields, we store them in a private server, accessible by executive staff only. From then on, anything you provide will be used specifically for the targeting of ads.<br /><br />
        At Product, to keep a Cost Per Mille (Per Thousand) very high and prestigious, we must provide our businesses with unparalleled support and unbeatable targeting. This creates a gap in user trust, but we must sacrifice one for the other. Public bias will always exist, but by sticking to our word of private handling of user info, we hope to inspire trust and flexibility in our userbase.</h2>
        <h3 class="blogs" style="font-size:18px;font-weight:600;">Categories and Descriptions</h3>
        <h2 class="blogs">The first category that we collect is, of course, your location. We must know where you live to provide you with ads from your city, state, or region. Without this, the CPM would remain extremely low and unfiltered. The usage of your current location is required by Product to continue functioning correctly.<br /><br />
            The next category we continue to collect for your safety is your age, sex, and education/work credentials. With this info, we can provide ads that are based on your job, can help your business or school environment, or are specifically advertised to match your sexual orientation. This continues to function, secondhandedly, as a security measure as well. Without this, we would not be able to know whether your credentials match the profile of a criminal.<br /><br />
            Another big category we collect is reading interest. We find this via your history of viewed articles. We have a timer built into each page (also known as a timeout functionality) to help our machine figure out what you spend time browsing and what you don't enjoy upon clicking. As stated before this paragraph, you do not have a choice over these categories. We keep these safe and private (even from third parties). It is also important for security and background checks.<br /><br />
            Next, on the topic of Product Groups, we collect info on the groups you spend the most time in, their title, their author, their main point, and the profiles of those involved in the group. This helps maintain a safe atmosphere and prevent malicious entities from working together to inject Product with malware or degenerative code.<br /><br />On the topic of News, we track what articles you find interest in. Again, we use timeout functionality and recommend articles that you seem to spend time reading.<br /><br />On the topic of Product Marketplace, we collect data on the items you sell, what you don't like anymore, and what you wish you could buy. This is for a few reasons. The first is because of the ads that could potentially be inserted to match your interest. The second is to check the hype around a brand and increase the CPM over interesting or high-ranking objects.<br /><br />
            <i>From the business side, being open with our users is more important than stating rules in the first place. Again, as stated, this info is completely required, and by creating an account, you agree to have your data handled this way.</i><br /><br />
    </h2>
    <h3 class="blogs" style="font-size:22px;font-weight:600;">Why are you so open about Data Use?</h3>
    <h2 class="blogs">At Product, our mission is to change the way people read and digest information. We need our environment to be clean and open for the correct functioning and operation of our environment. By letting users know why our business collects your data, we hope to shed some light on the business of marketing and advertising. It isn't easy, and the entire category as a whole is very competitive. Over the next few years, we hope to help you maintain an enjoyable browsing experience.</h2>
