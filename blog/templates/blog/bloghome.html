There is one thing that irks Product about the entire world: most people will never think for themselves. The herd mentality is strong, whether you are in a group of people or alone with a phone in your hand. We love to do what others are doing, especially when there are no consequences for doing it. If a herd of people are behaving like pigs at a dinner table, then you're more likely to follow this new way of acting -- even if it goes against your moral values (real study, by the way). A more impactful example is NASA. The only space organization to hold real missions that accomplish and get real results is the heavily-funded NASA. In fact, NASA spent $22.6 billion in taxpayer dollars as of 2020, and this money went to nothing, but perfecting something that has been done better by other companies.<br /><br />

NASA isn't bad, but the principle that they established can be. When a business does something insane, crazy, and over-the-edge, most people will take the example and apply it to their daily lives. For the select few that start rocket companies, they will (instead of formulating a plan from scratch) build off of NASA's technology at a similar or larger price. The 'said' business will spend more than $22.6 billion on its year of operation.<br /><br />

This isn't what a First Principles thinker would do.<br /><br />

<i>So what would they do?</i><br /><br />


Most would go ahead and doctor the designs and spend more, but an FPT would start <i>from scratch</i>. <br /><br />

What can I do to create this from my own knowledge and know-how? Can I buy spare parts or used parts or hire a team for less money? Can I design a rocket without looking up how-to's on a mass retailer FAQ, just because I know that it can save me time, money, and resources?<br /><br />

These questions helped Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, design and deploy massive rockets that cost almost 2/3 as much as a NASA first-stage rocket would cost. Numbers like this make you stop and question the reality of ideas in today's day and age. If we built everything in-house, could we change the world for the better? Could we do things more efficiently that would've otherwise costed our research money?<br /><br />

A good example of FPT that you can apply to your business is the following:<br /><br />

<b>Task Management</b>
Monday.com and similar websites charge a hefty sum of money for your team to have the luxury of connecting, adding, updating, and removing tasks on a productivity platform. What would happen if you built one in-house? With Python or some sort of Qt plugin, utilizing socket.io on the backend and SQL as the server architecture, you could create your own task management platform to help speed up and save money for your business. This wouldn't take much time or research, and websites that sell services <i>like</i> these <i>for idiots</i> would essentially have no more place in society. <i>Well, what would maintaining production software cost us?</i> It would, again, be based on FPT. If you follow the standard model of computer and cloud architecture, you could unknowingly start being charged a markup of how much a productivity platform would cost you if built in-house. This is yet another example of FPT that has allowed investors and entrepreneurs all around the world to save money and put funds where the promises lie.<br /><br />

Utilize FPT in every way possible (except this article, of course). Hopefully, this helps you along your journey.</p>
