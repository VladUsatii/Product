Product is a mass AI and subsidiary-specialized social media application available on the world wide web, including users, posts, notifications, profiles, user and post search, tags, picture posts, blog posts, a marketplace, weather, and so so much more. In fact, it had so much, I stopped adding to it because the user retention rate was plummmeting.

Check out the Business & Ads Section to learn about my ad algorithm implementation in vanilla Jinja. I used Python's Django and BeautifulSoup4 framework to put together a beautiful online experience.

One of the challenges in creating a new social media is the reputation that they have in 2021. They are known to capture all focus, time, and attention span from the average individual, and the added 'clean' finish to pages isn't doing anyone any favors. To combat major monopolistic behaviors between the big four, I designed a site that holds 10 items on a page, encourages writing and editing, has a strict be-honest policy, and encourages expression.

## Ads & Tracking

The best part of this site was abolishing the old 'Facebook-type' way of storing user data and replacing it with the 'Product-type' way of storing user data. We track only essential information that can help advertisers get to the correct audience, but we don't sell info in packages to companies.

Data is an important part of this project and learning how to query and sort it was a breakthrough in my coding knowledge.

## Django

Built with Django, it contains everything that Django has to offer (except for the REST framework), and we are even extending it to a React frontend in the near future.
